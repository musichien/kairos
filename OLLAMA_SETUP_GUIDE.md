   ```bash
   # For beginners (smaller, faster):
   ollama pull llama3.1:latest
   
   # For better responses (larger, slower):
   ollama pull llama3.1:8b
   
   # For Korean language support:
   ollama pull jinbora/deepseek-r1-Bllossom:8b
   ```

3. **Wait for the download to complete** (this may take several minutes)

   npm install
   ```

### Step 6: Start Ollama Server

   ```
   - This will start the Ollama server in the background
   - Keep this terminal window open

2. **Verify Ollama is running**:

   ollama list
   ```
   - This should show your downloaded models

### Step 7: Start Kairos Server

   - Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **You should see**:
   ```
   Server running on port 3000
   Kairos AI Memory Support Server is ready!
   ```

### Step 8: Access Kairos

1. **Local Access**:
   - Open your web browser
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000`
   - You should see the Kairos chat interface!

2. **External Access (Optional)**:
   - Open a new terminal
   - Navigate to your ngrok folder
   - Run:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```
   - Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
   - Share this URL with others to access your Kairos server

## üéâ You're Ready!

Once you see the chat interface, you can:
- Type messages and chat with your AI companion
- The AI will remember your conversations
- Your data stays private on your computer

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" error
- Make sure Node.js is installed properly
- Try closing and reopening your terminal
- Restart your computer if needed

### "Cannot connect to Ollama" error
- Make sure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Check if you downloaded a model: `ollama list`
- Try running `ollama serve` in a new terminal

### "Page not found" error
- Make sure you typed: `http://localhost:3000`
- Check if the server is running (you should see "Server running on port 3000")
- Try refreshing the page

### "ngrok not found" error
- Make sure ngrok is installed and in your PATH
- Try using the full path to ngrok
- For Windows: `C:\ngrok\ngrok.exe http 3000`

### Slow responses
- This is normal for the first few messages
- The AI needs time to "warm up"
