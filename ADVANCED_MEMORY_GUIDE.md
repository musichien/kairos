## üîÑ Intelligent Context Generation

### How It Works
The AI automatically generates rich context for each conversation by:

1. **Message Analysis**: Analyzes your current message for emotional state and intent
2. **Memory Retrieval**: Finds relevant memories based on topic similarity
3. **Emotional Context**: Considers emotional trends from recent conversations
4. **Relationship Context**: Includes information about people you mention
5. **Goal Integration**: References your current goals and progress
6. **Life Event Correlation**: Incorporates relevant life events

### Context Generation Example
```
User: "I'm thinking about changing careers"
AI Context Generation Process:
1. Analyzes message: Intent = career planning, Emotion = contemplative
2. Retrieves memories: Previous career discussions, job satisfaction mentions
3. Considers emotions: Recent stress about current job
4. Includes relationships: Supportive friends who've helped with decisions
5. References goals: Current learning objectives and skills
6. Correlates events: Recent work challenges and achievements

AI Response: "I understand you're considering a career change. 
I remember we've discussed your growing interest in AI development, 
and you've been feeling increasingly stressed with your current role. 
Your friend Sarah has been supportive of your career goals, 
and you've been making good progress learning Python. 
What specific aspects of your current career are making you want to change?"
```
