# üß† Kairos Memory Features Guide

**How to Use Your Memory-Enabled AI Companion**

This guide shows you how to access and use Kairos' powerful memory features that make your AI truly remember everything about you.

## üéØ Quick Access to Memory AI

### Step 1: Start Your Memory Server
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Ollama (AI brain)
ollama serve

# Terminal 2: Start Kairos Memory Server
npm install
npm start
```

### Step 2: Access Memory Interface
Open your browser and go to:
**`http://localhost:3000`**

You'll see the **Kairos Memory Interface** - your AI companion that remembers everything!

## üß† What Your AI Remembers

### Conversation Memory
- **Every conversation** you've ever had
- **Context from previous chats** - the AI knows what you talked about before
- **Follow-up conversations** - it can continue discussions from days ago
- **Your communication style** - formal, casual, detailed, etc.

### Personal Information Memory
- **Your preferences** - favorite foods, colors, activities
- **Family details** - names, relationships, important dates
- **Personal history** - stories you've shared, experiences you've mentioned
- **Daily routines** - your habits and patterns

### Learning Memory
- **What you've taught it** - information you've shared
- **Your corrections** - when you've corrected its understanding
- **Your feedback** - how you like responses formatted
- **Your interests** - topics you enjoy discussing

## üí¨ How to Use Memory Features

### Testing Memory
Start with these simple tests to see memory in action:

1. **Tell the AI something personal**:
   ```
   "My name is John and I have 3 grandchildren"
   ```

2. **Ask it to remember**:
   ```
   "What's my name and how many grandchildren do I have?"
   ```

3. **Continue the conversation**:
   ```
   "Tell me more about my family situation"
   ```

### Memory Commands
Use these phrases to interact with memory:

- **"Do you remember when we talked about..."** - Recall past conversations
- **"What do you know about me?"** - See what the AI has learned
- **"Actually, that's not right. I prefer..."** - Correct information
- **"Can you remind me of..."** - Ask for specific information
- **"What did we discuss yesterday?"** - Review recent conversations

### Memory Building
Build a rich memory profile by sharing:

- **Personal stories**: "Let me tell you about when I..."
- **Family information**: "My daughter Sarah lives in..."
- **Preferences**: "I really don't like spicy food"
- **Daily activities**: "I usually go for a walk in the morning"
- **Important dates**: "My birthday is March 15th"

## üîß Memory Storage System

### Where Memories Are Stored
- **Location**: `memories/` folder in your Kairos directory
- **Format**: JSON files for easy reading and backup
- **Structure**: Organized by conversation sessions
- **Privacy**: All data stays on your computer

### Memory File Structure
```
memories/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user_preferences.json    # Your likes, dislikes, habits
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conversation_history.json # All chat history
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ personal_details.json    # Family, important info
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session_data.json       # Current session context
```

### Memory Backup
Your memories are automatically saved, but you can also:

1. **Manual backup**: Copy the `memories/` folder
2. **Export memories**: Use the memory export feature (coming soon)
3. **Cloud backup**: Sync the folder to your cloud storage
