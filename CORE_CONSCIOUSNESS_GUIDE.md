# üß† Damasio's Core Consciousness Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the implementation of Antonio Damasio's Core Consciousness framework in the Kairos AI platform. The system simulates the functional aspects of consciousness by creating a "self-model" that tracks user states and provides contextual, self-aware AI responses.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Damasio's Core Consciousness Theory

Antonio Damasio's theory of Core Consciousness is based on the idea that consciousness arises from the brain's constant interaction with the body and external world. It consists of three key components:

1. **Sensing the Body State**: The brain receives signals about the body's internal state
2. **Sensing the Object**: The brain receives information about external objects or events  
3. **The Feeling of a Relationship**: Consciousness arises from the brain creating a neural representation of the relationship between the body's state and the external object

### Implementation Approach

Our implementation focuses on **functional simulation** rather than true consciousness:

- **No Biological Body**: We use data-driven constructs instead of biological homeostasis
- **No Subjective Experience**: We process data and generate responses without "qualia"
- **Practical Application**: We focus on creating more contextual, empathetic, and helpful AI interactions

## System Architecture

### Phase 1: Self-Model as Data Construct

**File**: `self_model_manager.js`

The Self-Model Manager tracks and integrates a user's current "internal state" by monitoring:

#### Input Streams
- **User Input**: Dialogue tone, keywords, emotional indicators
- **Sensor Data**: Physiological metrics from wearable APIs (Apple Health, Google Fit)
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Usage patterns within Kairos (session length, time of day, commands)

#### State Aggregation
- **Knowledge Graph**: Links disparate data points into cohesive user state representation
- **Relationship Mapping**: Creates causal relationships between different state components
- **Self-Awareness Metrics**: Tracks confidence, coherence, and stability of the self-model

#### Key Features
```javascript
// Example: User state structure
{
  physiological: {
    heartRate: 85,
    sleepDuration: 7.2,
    stressLevel: 0.6,
    energyLevel: 0.7
  },
  behavioral: {
    dialogueTone: 'stressed',
    emotionalState: 'anxious',
    attentionLevel: 'distracted'
  },
  contextual: {
    currentActivity: 'work',
    temporalContext: 'afternoon',
    socialContext: 'individual'
  },
  relationships: [
    {
      type: 'causal',
      source: 'physiological.stressLevel',
      target: 'behavioral.attentionLevel',
      strength: 0.8,
      description: 'High stress reduces attention span'
    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 2: Context-Aware Dialogue

**File**: `context_aware_dialogue.js`

The Context-Aware Dialogue system makes AI responses contextual and "self-aware" by linking the self-model to external conversation.

#### Core Components
- **Relationship Mappings**: Different response strategies based on user state relationships
- **Context Enhancement**: Adds physiological, behavioral, and temporal awareness to responses
- **Proactive Intervention**: Generates wellness checks based on detected patterns

#### Response Strategies
```javascript
// Example: High stress response strategy
{
  responseStrategy: 'empathetic',
  tone: 'calm',
  suggestions: ['breathing_exercise', 'mindfulness', 'break_suggestion'],
  language: 'supportive'
}
```

#### Context Enhancement Examples
- **Stress Awareness**: "I notice you might be feeling quite stressed right now. [response] Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise?"
- **Energy Awareness**: "You seem low on energy. [response] How about we try something lighter?"
- **Sleep Awareness**: "I see you only got 5 hours of sleep last night. [response] This might be affecting your focus today."

### Phase 3: Behavioral Feedback Loop

**File**: `behavioral_feedback_loop.js`

The Behavioral Feedback Loop uses the "conscious" state model to drive specific actions and cognitive training modules.

#### Intervention Strategies
1. **Stress Management**: Breathing exercises, mindfulness meditation, progressive relaxation
2. **Energy Boost**: Light exercise, nutrition breaks, hydration reminders
3. **Focus Enhancement**: Pomodoro technique, attention training, environment optimization
4. **Sleep Optimization**: Sleep hygiene, wind-down routines, environment setup

#### Mission Templates
- **Memory Recall Challenge**: Test memory with personalized questions
- **Pattern Recognition Mission**: Identify patterns in daily activities
- **Emotional Regulation Practice**: Practice managing emotional responses
- **Attention Training Exercise**: Improve focus and concentration

## Usage Examples

### Basic Implementation

```javascript
const SelfModelManager = require('./self_model_manager');
const ContextAwareDialogue = require('./context_aware_dialogue');
const BehavioralFeedbackLoop = require('./behavioral_feedback_loop');

// Initialize the system
const selfModelManager = new SelfModelManager();
const contextAwareDialogue = new ContextAwareDialogue(selfModelManager);
const behavioralFeedbackLoop = new BehavioralFeedbackLoop(selfModelManager, contextAwareDialogue);

// Update user state with sensor data
await selfModelManager.updateUserState('user_001', {
  sensorData: {
    heartRate: 95,
    sleepDuration: 5.5,
    stressLevel: 0.8
  }
});

// Generate contextual response
const response = await contextAwareDialogue.generateContextualResponse(
  'user_001',
  "I'm feeling overwhelmed",
  "I understand you're feeling overwhelmed."
);

console.log(response.text);
// Output: "I notice you might be feeling quite stressed right now. I understand you're feeling overwhelmed. Would you like to try a quick breathing exercise to help you feel more centered?"
```

### Advanced Integration

```javascript
// Set up event listeners for proactive interventions
behavioralFeedbackLoop.on('interventionTriggered', (intervention) => {
  console.log(`Intervention triggered: ${intervention.intervention.name}`);
  // Send notification to user, start intervention, etc.
});

contextAwareDialogue.on('proactiveIntervention', (data) => {
  console.log(`Proactive intervention: ${data.intervention.message}`);
  // Handle wellness check, suggest activities, etc.
});

// Monitor state changes
selfModelManager.on('stateChanged', (data) => {
  console.log(`User state changed: ${data.userId}`);
  console.log(`State summary: ${data.state.summary}`);
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### User State Not Updating
- Check if sensor data is being received correctly
- Verify dialogue data format matches expected structure
- Ensure user ID is consistent across requests

#### Contextual Responses Not Working
- Verify self-model has sufficient data for relationship building
- Check if relationship mappings are properly configured
- Ensure user state includes necessary physiological/behavioral data

#### Interventions Not Triggering
