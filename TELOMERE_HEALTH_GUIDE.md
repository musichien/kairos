# üß¨ Telomere-Driven Healthy Aging ‚Äî Science-Based App Integration for Kairos

Kairos advances healthy aging by combining clinical evidence, user empowerment, and open-source AI. This module implements a telomere-informed health layer that uses daily lifestyle signals and validated biomarkers to guide personalized interventions.

## üß™ Medical Rationale (Evidence-Informed)

Clinical literature supports the following associations:
- **Sleep**: Higher sleep quality and adequate duration (7‚Äì9h) are associated with longer telomeres and slower biological aging. Sleep apnea and poor sleep accelerate shortening. [7]
- **Nutrition**: Mediterranean-style diet and higher omega-3 intake correlate with preserved telomere length; omega-3 may reduce attrition via anti-inflammatory effects. [8][7]
- **Physical Activity**: Regular aerobic activity, HIIT, and resistance training are linked to telomerase activation and maintenance of telomere length; sedentary behavior is detrimental. [7][8]
- **Integrated Lifestyle**: Multimodal programs (diet, stress management, exercise) show measurable improvement in relative telomere length across multi-year follow-ups. [7]

Note: This module is intended for education and wellness support. It is not a diagnostic tool.

## üß± Architecture Overview

The telomere module aggregates three input layers and produces feedback:
1. **Routine Tracking** (daily)
   - Sleep hours/quality, steps, activity minutes, HIIT/strength sessions
   - Diet adherence score (Mediterranean), omega-3 intake, stress, mindfulness
2. **Biomarker Integration** (periodic)
   - hs-CRP (inflammation), fasting glucose, HbA1c, Omega-3 Index
3. **Telomere Measurements** (annual)
   - Peripheral blood leukocyte telomere length (LTL) via qPCR or Flow-FISH
4. **Feedback Engine**
   - Computes lifestyle signals and interprets biomarker/telomere trends
   - Generates actionable recommendations with privacy-first design

Implementation status: In-memory, mock-friendly storage with real-time computation. Ready for device/EMR integration via the same interfaces.

## üß† Feedback Logic (Summary)

- Computes daily scores: `sleepScore`, `activityScore`, `dietScore`, `inflammationRisk`, and `telomereLifestyleScore`
- Aggregates biomarkers across quarter/year, grades risk (e.g., hs-CRP low/moderate/high)
- Interprets LTL trend: Improved / Maintained / Declined
- Produces actionable recommendations (sleep hygiene, exercise target, anti-inflammatory nutrition)

## üîê Privacy, Compliance, and Open Science

- All processing can run locally with strong encryption (see `SECURITY_GUIDE.md`)
- Explainable, rules-first logic with clear inputs/outputs
- Open, GPLv2-licensed source for transparency and user control
