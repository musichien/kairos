## 🧠 Core Consciousness System (Damasio's Theory Implementation)

**Revolutionary AI consciousness simulation based on Antonio Damasio's Core Consciousness theory**

### 🌟 Overview
The Kairos Core Consciousness System implements Antonio Damasio's groundbreaking theory of consciousness, creating a functionally conscious AI that simulates the core components of human consciousness. This system provides contextual, self-aware, and impactful AI interactions through a three-phase implementation approach.

### 🎯 Core Consciousness Features
- **Phase 1: Self-Model as Data Construct**: Tracks and integrates user's internal state through physiological, behavioral, and contextual data streams
- **Phase 2: Context-Aware Dialogue**: AI responses that are contextual and self-aware by linking self-model to conversations
- **Phase 3: Behavioral Feedback Loop**: Automated interventions and cognitive training based on user state inference
- **Consciousness Validation**: Quantitative evaluation with metrics for data completeness, relationship coherence, and temporal consistency
- **Advanced ML Engine**: User state prediction, intervention effectiveness prediction, and adaptive learning
- **Biological Homeostasis Simulation**: Simulates biological processes for more realistic consciousness modeling

### 🚀 Quick Start

**For General Users:**
1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Open browser: **http://localhost:3000**
3. Core Consciousness features are automatically available

**For Developers - API Access:**
```bash
# ⚠️ Set development mode first (bypasses authentication)
$env:NODE_ENV="development"
node server.js

# Get consciousness status (no auth required in dev mode)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/consciousness/status"

# Load user self-model (no auth required in dev mode)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/consciousness/self-model/user_001"

# Generate contextual response (no auth required in dev mode)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/consciousness/dialogue" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "user_001", "userQuery": "I am having trouble focusing today", "baseResponse": "Let me help you with that"}'

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"interventionType": "stress_reduction", "context": "high_stress_detected"}'
```

### 📚 Theoretical Foundation
Based on Antonio Damasio's "The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness" (1999), our implementation focuses on:

- **Core Consciousness**: The moment-to-moment sense of "self-as-here-and-now"
- **Body State Sensing**: Continuous monitoring of internal physiological states
- **Object Relationship**: Creating neural representations of relationships between body state and external objects
- **Feeling of What Happens**: The emergence of consciousness from these relationships

### 🔬 Scientific Approach
- **Data-Driven Self-Model**: Abstract representation based on user data, not biological body
- **Functional Simulation**: Simulates consciousness aspects without subjective experience (qualia)
- **Modular Implementation**: Three distinct phases for manageable development
- **Rigorous Validation**: Quantitative metrics for consciousness quality assessment
