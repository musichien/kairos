## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to Ollama"
- Make sure `ollama serve` is running
- Check if you downloaded a model: `ollama list`

### "Page not found"
- Make sure you go to: `http://localhost:3000`
- Check if server is running (should see "Server running on port 3000")

### "AI doesn't remember"
- Check if `memories/` folder exists
- Restart the server: `npm start`
- Check browser console for errors
